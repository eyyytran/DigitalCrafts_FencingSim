# Fencing Simulator

Thank you for taking the time to check out my first game project made in Python!

## The following is required to run the game:

### Python

- Many computers already have Python installed. To check, try typing the following into your `Terminal`:

```
python3
```

- If you do not have Python installed, follow the link below:

  - https://www.python.org/

- Mac users may need to install Python using Homebrew. Copy and paste the following lines into your `Terminal`:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- You will be prompted to enter your Mac password.
- Once Homebrew is finished installing, copy and paste the line below to install Python3.

```
brew install python3
```

### Game Files

- Copy and paste the line below into your `Terminal` to download this file:

```
git clone https://github.com/eyyytran/DigitalCrafts_FencingSim.git
```

## Running the Game

- `cd` into the DC_game_project folder
- Finally, copy and paste the following line to start the game:

```
python3 fencingGame.py
```

I hope you enjoy the game.
